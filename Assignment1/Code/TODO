TODO ULTRA CRIT
- Run Tests for next data set
    - import data
    - examine dataset

- Somehow investigate how my datasets affect the algorithms
    - Check linear


TODO CRIT
- Listen to office hours
-
- Change dataset split seed when appropriate
    - random_state is only keeping constant the makeup of the data sets when split
- reimplement multi run all other tests to use this method


TODO: Requirements before submitting

TODO If time Later
- GridSearch

SVM
    - show training and test performance for two kernels

1. Decision Tree:
    - pruning
        - could just display the decision tree before and after pruning
    - could add partial-dependence-plots

### Report Notes ###

"I did X, I expected Y, I saw Z. I think this is because W".

All grading is done with the context of the results
    - giving descriptions of algorithms alone isn't useful

The reader understands the basics of ML algorithms

Don't provide a table of context, manage space well
    - use dual column

link results back to the tuning and back to the algorithm and how it performs in the dataset
    - example was how a decision tree select which features to split on
