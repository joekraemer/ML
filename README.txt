# ML
Repo for CS 7641

Code can be found at this GitHub repo: https://github.com/joekraemer/ML

## Assignment 1
Clone the repo and then simply call `python run.py` from the main directory

## Assignment 2
All of the problems can be run on their own, but to run the whole experiment its better to use run.py which runs all RO and NN tests.
Clone the repo and then simply call `python run.py` from the main directory

## Assignment 3
To run the whole experiment its better to use run_experiment.py which runs all DR, clustering and NN tests.
Clone the repo and then simply call `python run_experiment.py` from the main directory

## Assignment 4
In this assignment I used mdptoolbox, but needed to modify one of the file (mdp.py).
The modified file is tin the mdptoolbox_modifications folder.
This file will need to be copied into the mdptoolbox package before running these files.

Once the modified file is in mdptoolbox package directory, you can run the whole experiment.
To run the whole experiment its better to use run_experiment.py which runs all Policy Iteration, Value Iteration and Q-Learning tests.

### Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Move mdp.py to the mdptoolbox package
3. call `python run_experiment.py` from the main directory
