So I have 3 solvers, and 2 environments

This could be setup 6 unique experiments that run independently

so maybe I make an experiment object that takes a solver and environment


I'm going to want the folder structure to be like this
    output
        |
        ---> frozen_lake
                |
                ---> VI
                ---> PI
                ---> QLearning
        |
        ---> forest
                |
                ---> VI
                ---> PI
                ---> QLearning
