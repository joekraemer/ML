# TODO
- [x] Create separate solver classes ( or at least solver builders )
- [x] Create config files for separate solver classes
- [ ] Visualize the policies of the solver
- [x] Q Learning is somehow broken with Frozen Lake
- [ ] Create a runtime comparison experiment
- [ ] Create a runtime comparison visualization
- [ ] Fix the info logging in QLearning so that it has smoothing like VI/PI

- [ ] Create combined plots
  - [ ] hyper parameter
- [ ] Repeat experiments to capture variation between runs (definitely for QLearning)
- [ ] saved plots every few hundred episodes and turned them into a gif with imageio]

# Stream of consciousness
I can either change the QLearner class or change the environment

Now it looks like I have to do both?


visualizing the forest management can be just a series of strings?
